Last December, I gave a talk at Node+JS Interactive in Montreal, with the title **_JavaScript¬†apps going Inter-Planetary_**.

I was very excited to have the opportunity to speak for the first time at a large tech event, and I got to explain and demo something I'm very passionate about: building static web apps for the Distributed Web, and making them "production ready".

After briefly explaining **what is the Inter-Planetary File System** (IPFS) and how to interact with it, I showed how to **run a static JavaScript app** ([JAMstack]({{< ref "2019-11-16-your-next-app-may-not-have-a-backend" >}})) deployed through IPFS.

To make that app accessible to anyone in an easy manner, I then introduced using public **IPFS gateways** with Cloudflare, and **simpler URLs** thanks to the IPNS, or Inter-Planetary Name Service.

Lastly, I demoed how you can enable a full DevOps pipeline with **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery**, to automatically publish apps on the IPFS network.

üì∫ The full talk was recorded and is now on YouTube:

üßë‚Äçüíª The code used for the demo, as well as all the instructions to replicate it yourself, are published on GitHub at **[ItalyPaleAle/calendar-next-demo](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/calendar-next-demo)**.
