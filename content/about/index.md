My name is **Alessandro Segala**, and I am currently working for Microsoft as Product Marketing Manager for Open Source Software on Azure, helping developers writing code in Node.js, Golang, PHP and more to leverage our cloud! Previously, I was an Azure Technnology Solutions Professional (i.e. *Azure ninja*) for Microsoft Canada, and I have worked in various startups as full-stack developer and product manager.
