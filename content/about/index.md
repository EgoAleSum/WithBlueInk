Hi! I'm **Alessandro Segala**, and I'm currently working for Microsoft as a Product Marketing Manager for developer tools and open source software on Azure.

I'm also an author, having published my first book with Packt in September 2020: [**Svelte 3 Up and Running**](https://www.amazon.com/Svelte-Up-Running-practical-production-ready-ebook/dp/B08D6T6BKS).

Among the products I'm lucky to be working on at Microsoft is Visual Studio Code. I am also helping developers building apps with JavaScript/Node.js and Python on our Azure cloud platform.

I've been writing software, professionally and as a hobby, for over 15 years, using technologies including JavaScript/Node.js, Go, and previously PHP. I have experience building full-stack apps, and even had a stint building apps for iOS and macOS.
